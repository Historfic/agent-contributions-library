We are not clear
We are very not clear
On your left
On your left
Uh-huh, on my left
Don't you say it
You ready to follow Captain America into the jaws of death
That little guy from Brooklyn, that was too dumb not to run away from a fight
I'm following him
Well, if he could do that, he could achieve heavy ion fusion at any reactor on the planet
Someone who speaks English
Is that what just happened
Before we get started, does anyone want to get out
Secure channel seven
Did you do anything fun Saturday night
Well, all the guys from my barbershop quartet are dead, so no, not really
Can you hear me
It's probably too late to go to the bathroom, right
Put that hammer down
He loves you
You just ran like 13 miles in 30 minutes
Guess I got a late start
You know, if you ask Kristen out from statistics, she'd probably say yes
That's why I don't ask
Too shy or too scared
And I'd like to know how Loki used it to turn two of the sharpest men I know into his personal flying monkeys
You don't understand
I understood that reference
What about the nurse that lives across the hall from you
She seems kind of nice
Secure the engine room, then find me a date
You win wars with guts
Where did Captain America learn how to steal a car
And we're borrowing
Take your feet off the dash
What do you think
Yes, I think it works
That wasn't so bad
That was penicillin
Come on, soldier
Don't do anything stupid until I get back
How can I
I'm taking all the stupid with you
You're a punk
Is this little display meant to insinuate that you're gonna throw me off the roof
Because it's really not just style, Rogers
So you like cats
Dude shows up dressed like a cat, you don't want to know more
I've been on this all day
Oh wait, what about that girl from accounting
Lip piercing, right
Yeah, she's cute
I'm not ready for that
I thought you were dead
I thought you were smaller
What happened to you
I joined the army
You so uncomfortable
It's not exactly the word I would use
Looks like they're lining up
Well, they're excited
Did it air it
Is it permanent
No, Natasha, she likes to flirt
I've seen her flirt
This ain't that
What do you mean, up close
I had it
Mrs. Stark, you worry about bringing the city back down safely
The rest of us have one job
Tear these things apart
You get hurt, hurt them back
You get killed, walk it off
Notice who's copied my beard
Oh, by the way, this is a friend of mine, Tree
I am Groot
I am Steve Rogers
Come on, Cap
He's got increased metabolism and improved thermal homeostasis
Her thing is neuroelectric interfacing, telekinesis, mental manipulation
He's fast and she's weird
Got a suit
Then suit up
We're dealing with something new
Well, the vision's artificial intelligence
So it doesn't count
No, it's not like a person lifting the hammer
Different rules for us
File says they volunteered for Strucker's experiments
What kind of monster would let a German scientist experiment on them to protect their country
We're not at war, Captain
Well, what about you and Stark
How do I know you two haven't been fonduing
