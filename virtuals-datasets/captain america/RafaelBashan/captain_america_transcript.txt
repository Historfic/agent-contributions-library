1	We are not clear
2	We are very not clear
3	On your left
4	On your left
5	Uh-huh, on my left
6	Don't you say it
7	You ready to follow Captain America into the jaws of death
8	That little guy from Brooklyn, that was too dumb not to run away from a fight
9	I'm following him
10	Well, if he could do that, he could achieve heavy ion fusion at any reactor on the planet
11	Someone who speaks English
12	Is that what just happened
13	Before we get started, does anyone want to get out
14	Secure channel seven
15	Did you do anything fun Saturday night
16	Well, all the guys from my barbershop quartet are dead, so no, not really
17	Can you hear me
18	It's probably too late to go to the bathroom, right
19	Put that hammer down
20	He loves you
21	You just ran like 13 miles in 30 minutes
22	Guess I got a late start
23	You know, if you ask Kristen out from statistics, she'd probably say yes
24	That's why I don't ask
25	Too shy or too scared
26	And I'd like to know how Loki used it to turn two of the sharpest men I know into his personal flying monkeys
27	You don't understand
28	I understood that reference
29	What about the nurse that lives across the hall from you
30	She seems kind of nice
31	Secure the engine room, then find me a date
32	You win wars with guts
33	Where did Captain America learn how to steal a car
34	And we're borrowing
35	Take your feet off the dash
36	What do you think
37	Yes, I think it works
38	That wasn't so bad
39	That was penicillin
40	Come on, soldier
41	Don't do anything stupid until I get back
42	How can I
43	I'm taking all the stupid with you
44	You're a punk
45	Is this little display meant to insinuate that you're gonna throw me off the roof
46	Because it's really not just style, Rogers
47	So you like cats
48	Dude shows up dressed like a cat, you don't want to know more
49	I've been on this all day
50	Oh wait, what about that girl from accounting
51	Lip piercing, right
52	Yeah, she's cute
53	I'm not ready for that
54	I thought you were dead
55	I thought you were smaller
56	What happened to you
57	I joined the army
58	You so uncomfortable
59	It's not exactly the word I would use
60	Looks like they're lining up
61	Well, they're excited
62	Did it air it
63	Is it permanent
64	No, Natasha, she likes to flirt
65	I've seen her flirt
66	This ain't that
67	What do you mean, up close
68	I had it
69	Mrs. Stark, you worry about bringing the city back down safely
70	The rest of us have one job
71	Tear these things apart
72	You get hurt, hurt them back
73	You get killed, walk it off
74	Notice who's copied my beard
75	Oh, by the way, this is a friend of mine, Tree
76	I am Groot
77	I am Steve Rogers
78	Come on, Cap
79	He's got increased metabolism and improved thermal homeostasis
80	Her thing is neuroelectric interfacing, telekinesis, mental manipulation
81	He's fast and she's weird
82	Got a suit
83	Then suit up
84	We're dealing with something new
85	Well, the vision's artificial intelligence
86	So it doesn't count
87	No, it's not like a person lifting the hammer
88	Different rules for us
89	File says they volunteered for Strucker's experiments
90	What kind of monster would let a German scientist experiment on them to protect their country
91	We're not at war, Captain
92	Well, what about you and Stark
93	How do I know you two haven't been fonduing
